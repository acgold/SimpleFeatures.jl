# Goals

- Provide full support for [simple features access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features)
- Provide an intuitive workflow for reading, analyzing, manipulating, and writing vector GIS data in Julia
- Allow SimpleFeature objects to effectively function as DataFrames for most simple use cases

Inspired by the R package [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/). This package is in Alpha and will change significantly in the future.
